      <p>Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate seasons, succeeding winter and preceding summer. There are various technical definitions of spring, but local usage of the term varies according to local climate, cultures and customs. When it is spring in the Northern Hemisphere, it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. At the spring (or vernal) equinox, days and nights are approximately twelve hours long, with daytime length increasing and nighttime length decreasing as the season progresses.</p>

      <p> Spring and "springtime" refer to the season, and also to ideas of rebirth, rejuvenation, renewal, resurrection and regrowth. Subtropical and tropical areas have climates better described in terms of other seasons, e.g. dry or wet, monsoonal or cyclonic. Cultures may have local names for seasons which have little equivalence to the terms originating in Europe.</p>

      <p>According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, the word itself derives from the Old English word "springan," which means "to leap, burst forth, fly up; spread, grow." It, in turn, developed from the Proto-Germanic "sprengan." During the 14th century, the word came to describe the spring season, indicating the time when plants rise from their winter dormancy and bloom. </p>
