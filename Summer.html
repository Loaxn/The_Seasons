      <p>Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, occurring after spring and before autumn. At or centred on the summer solstice, the earliest sunrise and latest sunset occurs, daylight hours are longest and dark hours are shortest, with day length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate, tradition, and culture. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa</p>

      <p>From an astronomical view, the equinoxes and solstices would be the middle of the respective seasons,but sometimes astronomical summer is defined as starting at the solstice, the time of maximal insolation, often identified with the 21st day of June or December. By solar reckoning, summer instead starts on May Day and the summer solstice is Midsummer. A variable seasonal lag means that the meteorological centre of the season, which is based on average temperature patterns, occurs several weeks after the time of maximal insolation.</p>

      <p>The word summer is quite old. It’s recorded before the year 900 and comes from the Old English word for the season, sumor. It’s related to the Dutch zomer, the German Sommer, and the Sanskrit samā (which means “year”). Summer became an adjective around 1300, and terms like summer camp, summer school, and summer resort are all first recorded in the 1800s.</p>
